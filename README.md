# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud efficiently. Credit card fraud is a critical concern in financial transactions, and traditional rule-based systems often fall short in capturing sophisticated fraudulent patterns. This solution employs machine learning algorithms, including neural networks and ensemble methods, to analyze transaction data and identify anomalies indicative of fraud.
